    ->Position and order of appearance: the order in which your CSS rules appear
    ->Specificity: an algorithm that determines which CSS selector has the strongest match
    ->Origin: the order in which CSS appears and where it comes from, whether that is a browser style, CSS from a browser   extension, or your authored CSS
    ->Importance: some CSS rules are weighted more heavily than others, especially with the !important rule type
    Lets look into all these one by one
